   - Built using FastAPI.
   - Includes model artifacts and preprocessing logic.
   - Contains unit tests for quality assurance.
   - Uses Docker for containerization.
   - Provides an API interface for making predictions.
   - More details are available in `my_ml_api/README.md`.

2. **training/** - This folder is dedicated to training and analyzing the machine learning model.
   - Includes data processing scripts.
   - Contains a Jupyter Notebook for model training.
   - Stores dataset files and trained model artifacts.
   - Uses utility scripts for data preprocessing, feature selection, and model training.
